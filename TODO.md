# todo

- how to export as vanilla js?
  - see todo in store
- use `now` to deploy player to s3?
- add redux for currentTrack/Playlist and player settings
- capture meta on track length
  - simplify update by just deleting meta file?
  - split out step that reads mp3s for meta, probably the slow part
