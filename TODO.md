# todo

- how to export as vanilla js?
- use `now` to deploy player to s3
- add redux for currentTrack/Playlist and player settings
- capture meta on track length
  - simplify update by just deleting meta file?
  - split out step that reads mp3s for meta, probably the slow part
- nextTrack on song end
- implement repeat
  - notion of "force" on nextTrack
  - refactor nextTrack to share logic with prev and obey settings
- implement shuffle
  - on playlist creation, make shuffle array pointing to same track objs
  - on next/prev, check shuffle arg to determine which arr to use for lookup
- playlist for By Album, By Artist that lead to secondary view
  - enum on App for browsing album/artist
  - album view uses meta from first track
- put entire App into box thats perfectly fit to screen
  - have the top and sidebar collapse by going into negative margin
  - have everything flex-fill in its dimmension to seamlessly animate when other comps disappear
- constant that reads windw.config, determines "whitelist" and "sidebar visible"
  - if whitelist, only use songs from those playlists to populate AllSong, Albums, etc
  - else, use collection.tracks
- config can be determined via global obj (embed) or query param (main app)
  - load config before const
